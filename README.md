Now, it's story time. This is the tale of a lonely coffee cup. It's not the type of tale mummy reads her babies, but that's largely because young children don't drink coffee.
Our story begins on a shelf. Cody the coffee cup was lonely. Their owner, and I should note here that Cody is agender because coffee cups do not have any differentiated sense of self that could give rise to gender, had not used Cody for a long time. That was because at some point, they switched to drinking tea. Not just any tea, but specifically kong fu tea, which uses more specific cups which are generally significantly smaller than coffee cups. This was nice for the owner, but it meant Cody just sat on the shelf, gathering dust.
One day there was an earthquake. Cody began to bounce up and down on the shelf. They weren't able to do anything, because in the absence of a muscle system Cody was incapable of independent movement. Fortunately it was a minor earthquake and Cody didn't even fall over, let alone tumble from the shelf. In another story, this would be when the owner noticed Cody, and recalled their caffeine swigging days. However, they were out at work when the quake happened so nothing came of this.
Yeah, this story does not go anywhere. It's literally just an inanimate coffee cup bouncing up and down during an earthquake. It could have happened in literally anyone's cupboard. But hey, I got you to waste time reading this :P
